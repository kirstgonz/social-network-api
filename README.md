The Social Network API

## Description

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- Express
- Mongoose package
- MongoDB
- Insomnia

## Usage and Website

[The Social Network API](https://github.com/kirstgonz/social-network-api) helps users post their thoughts and ideas and allows for interacting with others. Users can add or delete friends and react to friend's posts. 

If you want to run this application from the command line, you must first install all the dependencies through the command line by typing in 'npm init -y', 'npm i', and then run 'npm start'. The routes can then be tested through the Insomnia application.
